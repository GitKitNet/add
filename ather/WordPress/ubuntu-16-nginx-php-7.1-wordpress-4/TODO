# Wordpress updates and installation.
#
# When deployed to openshift our image cannot update or install plugins or themes automatically. It can fine when running as a non-root user set locally.
# Potential fix is to add 'define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');' to wp-config file however this isn't generated until after customer has completed installation.
